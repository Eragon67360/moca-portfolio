It exports this function as the default export, which is called asynchronously. The function takes the locale as an argument and returns a configuration object with the messages from a JSON file specific to the locale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It also enables experimental server actions and customizes the webpack config to handle audio file imports using url-loader and file-loader. The resulting config is exported for use in the Next.js project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
